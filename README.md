# WaterPIP
Code to monitor trends in Water Productivity using the WaPOR dataset (https://wapor.apps.fao.org/) and the Google-Earth-Engine. Users can provide a shapefile as input, the script then processes several FAO WaPOR datasets and outputs a PDF-file, showing trends in Biomass-production, Water Consumption and Water Productivity in several graphs, maps and tables for the area of interest. Non-significant trends are masked.
